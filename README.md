# Comparing Different Models for Sentiment analysis.

In this project I am trying to compare the performance of Trainable Bert Large models vs MLP, CNN, LSTM models for sentiment analysis of reviews given by users for different products in amazon. <br />
For preprocessing of Data refer notebook : [Data_preprocessing.ipynb](https://github.com/biswajit2sen/Sentiment_analysis_amazon_fine_food_review/blob/main/Data_preprocessing.ipynb). <br />

## Data Collection
we get our data from : https://www.kaggle.com/snap/amazon-fine-food-reviews <br />
This dataset consists of reviews of fine foods from amazon. The data span a period of more than 10 years, including all ~500,000 reviews up to October 2012. Reviews include product and user information, ratings, and a plain text review. <br />
