She started out with original Cat Chow, then I tried Eukanuba hairball formula, and eventually Science Diet sensitive stomach formula, which was by far the most problematic, causing her to throw up at least once daily.  My vet recommended a natural brand, and a Petsmart employee suggested the Blue Buffalo indoor formula specifically.  That was about three weeks ago, and knock on wood, she hasn't vomited once since.  Not only that, but she's actually become more affectionate now that she's not in a constant state of discomfort and stomach distress.  Her chronic dandruff has also almost completely disappeared, and both of my cats are shedding quite a bit less.  Their coats are softer and shinier than they've ever been before, and to top it all off, since Blue Buffalo has no fillers, they're actually getting full while eating less of it, and are defecating less frequently.  This food was truly a godsend for my sensitive-stomach kitty, and the additional coat benefits were amazing and completely unexpected.  I will offer the warning, however, that although my cats took to BB immediately when it was slowly mixed in with their old food, my mom's cats refuse to eat it.  I recommend buying different flavors one at a time in the smallest quantity available until you make sure you've found one your cat(s) will eat.  Definitely worth the price, especially if, like me, you've been buying expensive Eukanuba or Science Diet already!</td>\n",

              "226668  This was the fourth brand I tried due to my female shorthair cat's frequent vomiting without any sign of hairballs.  She started out with original Cat Chow, then I tried Eukanuba hairball formula, and eventually Science Diet sensitive stomach formula, which was by far the most problematic, causing her to throw up at least once daily.  My vet recommended a natural brand, and a Petsmart employee suggested the Blue Buffalo indoor formula specifically.  That was about three weeks ago, and knock on wood, she hasn't vomited once since.  Not only that, but she's actually become more affectionate now that she's not in a constant state of discomfort and stomach distress.  Her chronic dandruff has also almost completely disappeared, and both of my cats are shedding quite a bit less.  Their coats are softer and shinier than they've ever been before, and to top it all off, since Blue Buffalo has no fillers, they're actually getting full while eating less of it, and are defecating less frequently.  This food was truly a godsend for my sensitive-stomach kitty, and the additional coat benefits were amazing and completely unexpected.  I will offer the warning, however, that although my cats took to BB immediately when it was slowly mixed in with their old food, my mom's cats refuse to eat it.  I recommend buying different flavors one at a time in the smallest quantity available until you make sure you've found one your cat(s) will eat.  Definitely worth the price, especially if, like me, you've been buying expensive Eukanuba or Science Diet already!      5"
